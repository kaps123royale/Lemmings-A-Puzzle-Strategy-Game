# Lemmings-A-Puzzle-Strategy-Game
A 2D motion strategy game was designed using verilog in Xilinx vivado tool. 
A sequential circuit is needed to implement the logic of executing different movements on encountering various scenarious. A Moore machine was used with asynchronous reset to get it work. The state tranistion logic along with the next state logic was coded using xilinx-vivado.

These are the simulations result, that we can see various movement output signals are changing when the input gets changed.
